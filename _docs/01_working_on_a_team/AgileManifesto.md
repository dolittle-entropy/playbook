# The agile manifesto

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through
> this work e have come to value:
>
> *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools<br>
> *Working software* over comprehensive documentation<br>
> *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation<br>
> *Responding to change* over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We believe in the values expressed in the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) and stand
behind the [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) behind the manifesto.

## Principles behind the agile manifesto
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
