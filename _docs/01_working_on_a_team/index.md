# Welcome to our engineering playbook!

## What is the purpose of this playbook?

* To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
* Reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
* Strive to be a better engineer and learn from other people's shared experience.

## Everyone working in customer delivery...

* is responsible to their team for their deliveries, but also strives to mentor, coach and lead and learn from them.
* knows their **playbook** and follows their playbook. They fix their playbook if it is broken, and improve it when they can. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use their playbook, they share it.
* leads by example. They model the behaviors they desire in others both interpersonally and technically (This is what most people think of as a "developer").
* strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context to ensure the needed outcome.

This is the playbook. This playbook is yours and ours. Please contribute to it via standard git pull-requests on GitHub.
