# Recommended tools
Do not write your own version of something that already exists - use the thing that exists!
The inclination to re-write something or highly customise it beyond recognition because it is
*not invented here* is seductive, but resist it! Down that path lies muda.

Rather, adapt to existing tools to draw upon the value already made, and reach further by standing
on the shoulders of giants. This also places large parts of your system outside your control and
(surprisingly) this is a huge boon. You will no longer be the one everyone depends on to support it,
and it empowers others to fix that part.

Your home-grown system will also be quickly outpaced by something that someone actually cares about
and maintains. Not to mention that learning about a common library or pattern is much easier and
more valuable to new developers than learning about your particular, ever unfinished re-implementation
of it.

With this in mind, sometimes it does make sense to make your own tools. If it is core to your domain
and nothing else exists that you can build on you might need to build your own thing. This is very,
very rare - but it does happen.
