## General guidance
- Keep the code quality high
- Value quality and correctness over ‘getting things done’
- Work diligently to identify and solve on the most important thing first
- As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams and backlog items
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow
- Avoid adding scope to a existing takss, instead add that scope as deferred tasks for later attention
- Our goal is to ship incremental customer value
- Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team
- Report product issues you've found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback so we can improve!
- Report process issues you've found and provide clear feedback so we can improve how we work!
- We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great
