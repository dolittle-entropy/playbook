# Maintaining a running system
- what is devops, and why is it important?
- different environments and why we use them
- the responsibility for operational concerns
- "non-functional" requirements (we need a better term for this, it sounds too much like un-functional)
- threat modelling
- how to handle incidents
- escalation
- SLAs
- using production-learnings to improve the product
- don't use production-data in dev/test
