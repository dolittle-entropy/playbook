# Dolittle Customer Success Play-Book
This is a living document about how to help customers find success, with a particular slant to
working on the Dolittle platform.

We have collated text from many sources into this play-book, and we hope it will help you. If you
find it helpful, please share it with others and consider evolving it further with us by submitting
changes and improvements back to it, or making your own version tailored to your needs and preferences.

## Why do we have a Playbook?
- To increase overall hapiness and effectivity of team members and the whole team
- To document learnings and experience with what works and what does not work and lead to a more enjoyable and effective future
- Reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls
- Strive to be a better developer, engineer, advisor and person and learn from other peopleâ€™s shared experience


## Sections

The play-book is divided into sections that consider specific themes.
1. Landing page (this section)
2. Working in a team
3. Creating software
4. Maintaining a running system

## How to contribute

This play-book is/should be hosted in a public repository on GitHub. We encourage and appreciate any improvements to it
delivered via pull-request to this repository. The pull-request -process is described in the section on [working with git
and github](add-link-here).

## Sections that exist, but need work
- [Working on a Team](docs/01_working_on_a_team/index)
- [The Dolittle Platform](docs/02_Creating_Software/03_The_Dolittle_Platform/index)
  - [EDA](docs/02_Creating_Software/03_The_Dolittle_Platform/EDA)
  - [Microservices](docs/02_Creating_Software/03_The_Dolittle_Platform/Microservices)
- [Maintaining a Running System](docs/03_maintaining_a_running_system/index)

## Other things needed
The pages are not perfectly organised right now. Pages that talk about how to work in with and in a team
should be mostly under the Working on a Team -section, and the "harder" code and day-to-day tools -things
should be pulled into the "Creating Software" -section. Some of this is to separate parts of a single
page into the "soft" and the "hard" aspects of one thing.

## License
TODO figure out which license to use - is this supposed to be creative-commons? perhaps public domain?
