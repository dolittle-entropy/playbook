# Dolittle Customer Success Play-Book
This is a living document about how to help customers find success, with a particular slant to working on the Dolittle
platform.

We have collated text from many sources into this play-book, and we hope it will help you. If you find it helpful, please
share it with others and consider evolving it further with us by submitting changes and improvements back to it, or
making your own version tailored to your needs and preferences.

## Sections

The play-book is divided into sections that consider specific themes.
1. Landing page (this section)
2. Working in a team
3. Creating software
4. Maintaining a running system

## How to contribute

This play-book is/should be hosted in a public repository on GitHub. We encourage and appreciate any improvements to it
delivered via pull-request to this repository. The pull-request -process is described in the section on [working with git
and github](add-link-here).

## Sections that don't yet exist
- how to run hackathons
- how to do event-stormings
- how to break up an "epic" into smaller delierables
- how to work remotely
- how to identify a product-owner
- something about not inventing new stuff, use existing stuff instead (only make the core domain)
- recommended things to use
  - fluent ui
  - react?
  - aurelia
  - mongo
  - dapper
  - fluent validations
  - node

## Sections that exist, but need work
- [The Dolittle Platform](docs/02_Creating_Software/03_The_Dolittle_Platform/index)
  - [EDA](docs/02_Creating_Software/03_The_Dolittle_Platform/EDA)
  - [Microservices](docs/02_Creating_Software/03_The_Dolittle_Platform/Microservices)
- [Maintaining a Running System](docs/03_maintaining_a_running_system/index)

## Other things needed
The pages are not perfectly organised right now. Pages that talk about how to work in with and in a team
should be mostly under the Working on a Team -section, and the "harder" code and day-to-day tools -things
should be pulled into the "Creating Software" -section. Some of this is to separate parts of a single
page into the "soft" and the "hard" aspects of one thing.

## License
TODO figure out which license to use - is this supposed to be creative-commons? perhaps public domain?
