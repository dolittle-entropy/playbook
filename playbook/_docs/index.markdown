# Dolittle Customer Delivery Engineering Playbook

An engineer working for a Customer Delivery project...

* Has responsibilities to their team - mentor, coach and lead.
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use your playbook, give them yours.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically (This is what most people think of as a "developer")
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This is the playbook. You are invited to contribute via standard git pull requests to GitHub.

## Why have a Playbook?
- To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general
- Reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls
- Strive to be a better engineer and learn from other people’s shared experience

## General Guidance
- Keep the code quality bar high
- Value quality and precision over ‘getting things done’
- Work diligently on the one important thing
- As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams and backlog items
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow
- Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead add a new backlog item
- Our goal is to ship incremental customer value
- Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team
- Report product issues found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback!
- We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great
