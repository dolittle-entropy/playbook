# Dolittle Customer Delivery Engineering Playbook

An engineer working for a Customer Delivery project...

* Has responsibilities to their team - mentor, coach and lead.
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use your playbook, give them yours.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically (This is what most people think of as a "developer")
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This is the playbook. You are invited to contribute via standard git pull requests to GitHub.

>This playbook was originally copied from Microsoft's CSE Code-With Customer/Partner Engineering Playbook.
