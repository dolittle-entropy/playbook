Someone working in a Customer Delivery project ...

* is responsible to their team for their deliveries, but also strives to mentor, coach and lead and learn from them.
* knows their **playbook** and follows their playbook. They fix their playbook if it is broken, and improve it when they can. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use their playbook, they share it.
* leads by example. They model the behaviors they desire in others both interpersonally and technically (This is what most people think of as a "developer").
* strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context to ensure the needed outcome.

This is the playbook. This playbook is yours and ours. Please contribute to it via standard git pull-requests on GitHub.

## General Guidance
- Keep the code quality high
- Value quality and correctness over ‘getting things done’
- Work diligently to identify and solve on the most important thing first
- As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams and backlog items
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow
- Avoid adding scope to a existing takss, instead add that scope as deferred tasks for later attention
- Our goal is to ship incremental customer value
- Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team
- Report product issues you've found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback so we can improve!
- Report process issues you've found and provide clear feedback so we can improve how we work!
- We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great
