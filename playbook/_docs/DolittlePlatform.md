# The Dolittle Platform
While engaging with customers, we try to stick with best practices in architecture for development and design that leverage
the Dolittle platform where appropriate, and offer guidance for where it does not fit. 

## Goals
* Identify areas of a solution where Dolittle Platform is a perfect fit
* Be honest and open about areas where the Dolittle Platform is not a good fit
* Strive to find workarounds for challenges that aren't met by the current state of the Dolittle platform
* Be active in reporting back to the R&D team about bugs or missing features that are impeding a smooth delivery
